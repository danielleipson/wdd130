    <p>Hello! I am a mom to 6 boys. I work full time as a school registrar. I am just beginning to come back to school after taking a break. I am excited to be here learning new skills. I have enjoyed learning how to code so far. My husband has been trying to teach me for several years and I have not taken the time to do so. I appreciate the motivation this class has given me to actually do it.</p>

    <p>I am looking at going into computer science or software development as my major. My hobbies are painting, gardening, singing or listening to music, reading, and being outside with my family.</p>

    <p> I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for about 26 years. Two of my favorite scriptures are Matthew 11:28 <blockquote><em><q>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</q></em></blockquote> The other one is 2 Nephi 9:39 <blockquote><em><q>O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in transgressing against that Holy God, and also the awfulness of yeilding to the enticings of that cunning one. Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.</q></em></blockquote>I like both of these scriptures because they both remind me of what I am here for.. to focus on the Savior and find joy in the jouney. Also that I can turn to Him and He will give me rest once I have put forth my best efforts.</p>
